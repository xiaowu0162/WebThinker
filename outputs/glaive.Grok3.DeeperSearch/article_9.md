### Introduction to the Myth
The story of Romulus and Remus, twin brothers raised by a she-wolf and founders of Rome, can enrich a 4th-grade social studies curriculum. It offers a historical and cultural lens to explore community building and civic responsibility, while its themes of violence and fratricide require sensitive handling for young learners.

### Connecting to Curriculum Goals

### Survey Note: Detailed Integration of Romulus and Remus into 4th-Grade Curriculum

This note provides a comprehensive exploration of integrating the myth of Romulus and Remus into a 4th-grade social studies curriculum, focusing on community building and civic responsibility, while addressing the sensitive themes of violence and fratricide. It aims to offer educators a detailed framework, supported by research and resources, to ensure age-appropriate and effective teaching.

#### Background and Context of the Myth
The story of Romulus and Remus, as detailed in sources like [Wikipedia: Romulus and Remus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus) and [Britannica: Romulus and Remus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Romulus-and-Remus), is a foundational myth of ancient Rome. The twins, born to Rhea Silvia and allegedly fathered by Mars, were abandoned and raised by a she-wolf. They later founded Rome, but a dispute over the city's location led to Romulus killing Remus, establishing himself as Rome's first king. This narrative, while central to Roman identity, includes elements of violence and fratricide that require careful consideration for 4th-grade students, typically aged 9-10, who are developing critical thinking and moral reasoning skills.

The myth's historical context, as noted in [World History Encyclopedia: Romulus and Remus](https://www.worldhistory.org/Romulus_and_Remus/), suggests it was used to explain Rome's origins and reflect cultural values, such as leadership and community formation. Given that 4th-grade curricula, as seen in [NYC Social Studies & Civics Hub - 4th Grade](https://sites.google.com/schools.nyc.gov/social-studies-and-civics/resources-by-grade/elementary/4th-grade), often focus on state or national history, integrating this myth may require aligning it with broader themes of community and civic engagement, potentially as part of a unit on ancient civilizations or cultural stories.

#### Curriculum Integration: Community Building
Community building, a key focus for 4th graders, can be explored through the myth's depiction of Rome's founding. Romulus's actions post-conflict, such as establishing the Senate and inviting settlers, as mentioned in [Britannica: Romulus and Remus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Romulus-and-Remus), illustrate early community organization. Educators can highlight how these efforts required cooperation, leadership, and the creation of shared spaces, aligning with curriculum goals like those in [Utah Core: 4th Grade Social Studies](https://www.uen.org/core/core.do?courseNum=6040), which emphasize understanding community structures.

To teach this, consider a lesson where students discuss how Romulus built Rome, focusing on:
- Attracting settlers, including the story of the Sabine women, to show community growth.
- Establishing laws and institutions, introducing the concept of governance.
- Activities like drawing maps of early Rome or role-playing community meetings to reinforce these ideas.

#### Curriculum Integration: Civic Responsibility
Civic responsibility, another curriculum focus, can be linked to the myth by exploring the duties of early Roman citizens. As noted in [World History Encyclopedia: Romulus and Remus](https://www.worldhistory.org/Romulus_and_Remus/), Romulus's leadership involved setting up civic structures, such as military service and public participation, which can be compared to modern civic duties like voting or community service, as seen in [Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Social Studies](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/education/programs-and-services/instruction/elementary-and-secondary-education/curriculum/social-studies.html).

A lesson could include:
- Discussing what it means to be a good citizen, using examples from the myth (e.g., contributing to Rome's defense).
- Comparing ancient and modern civic responsibilities, perhaps through a Venn diagram activity.
- Encouraging students to identify ways they can contribute to their school or local community, reinforcing personal relevance.

#### Addressing the Controversy: Violence and Fratricide
The myth's violent elements, particularly Romulus killing Remus, pose a challenge for 4th-grade teaching. Research from [Bright Hub Education: Myth Lesson Plans](https://www.brighthubeducation.com/lesson-plans-grades-1-2/114385-what-are-myths/) suggests that myths with violence can be taught by focusing on moral lessons and using age-appropriate language. For Romulus and Remus, educators can:
- Present the conflict as a disagreement over the city's location, stating that "in their argument, Remus was killed," without graphic details, as recommended in [Edutopia: Using Myths to Teach Different Cultures](https://www.edutopia.org/article/using-myths-teach-different-cultures/).
- Frame the violence within its historical context, explaining that myths often reflect the values of their time, and discuss how our values today prioritize peaceful conflict resolution.
- Use discussion prompts like, "What could Romulus and Remus have done differently?" to foster critical thinking, aligning with [Iowa Social Studies Standards for Grade 4](https://educate.iowa.gov/pk-12/standards/academics/social-studies-standards/grade-4), which emphasize analyzing causes of conflict.

To mitigate potential discomfort, consider activities like rewriting the story with a peaceful ending, as suggested in [Share My Lesson: Romulus & Remus Lesson Plan](https://sharemylesson.com/teaching-resource/romulus-remus-298766), or comparing it to less violent founding stories, such as the Pilgrims' Mayflower Compact, to highlight different approaches to community building.

#### Educational Resources and Activities
Resources from [Teachers Pay Teachers: Romulus and Remus](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=romulus%2Band%2Bremus) offer lesson plans, worksheets, and activities tailored for elementary students, including comprehension questions and role-playing scripts. For example, a script-story can engage students in retelling the myth, while comprehension questions can assess understanding of community and civic themes.

Suggested activities include:
- **Role-playing:** Students act out the founding of Rome, modifying the ending to show cooperation, as seen in [Mythology for Kids – Creative English Teacher](https://creativeenglishteacher.com/pages/mythology-for-kids).
- **Writing assignment:** Students write an alternative ending where Romulus and Remus resolve their conflict, reinforcing conflict resolution skills.
- **Group project:** Design an imaginary community, deciding on laws and leadership, to apply lessons on civic responsibility, aligning with [Kennedy Center: A World of Myths](https://www.kennedy-center.org/education/resources-for-educators/classroom-resources/lessons-and-activities/lessons/6-8/a-world-of-myths/).

#### Comparative Analysis and Cultural Relevance
To enhance learning, compare Romulus and Remus with other founding myths, such as the Iroquois creation story, to show cultural diversity, as suggested in [Varsity Tutors: Mythology Teaching Resources](https://www.varsitytutors.com/englishteacher/myth). This can be presented in a table for clarity:

| Myth                | Culture         | Focus on Community | Civic Responsibility | Violent Elements |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Romulus and Remus   | Ancient Rome    | Founding of Rome    | Establishing laws    | Yes (fratricide) |
| Iroquois Creation   | Native American | Sky World community | Roles in society     | No               |
| Mayflower Compact   | American        | Cooperation pact    | Shared governance    | No               |

This comparison can lead to discussions on how different cultures value community and conflict resolution, enhancing cultural awareness and aligning with [Edutopia: Using Myths to Teach Different Cultures](https://www.edutopia.org/article/using-myths-teach-different-cultures/).

#### Conclusion and Implementation
Integrating Romulus and Remus into a 4th-grade curriculum requires balancing historical accuracy with age-appropriate content. By focusing on community building and civic responsibility, and addressing violence through discussion and alternative activities, educators can create a rich learning experience. The approach should be flexible, adapting to state standards like those in [South Carolina Social Studies Standards](https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards/social-studies/standards/), and supported by resources from [School History: Romulus and Remus Worksheets](https://schoolhistory.co.uk/ancient-world/romulus-and-remus/), ensuring both engagement and educational value.
